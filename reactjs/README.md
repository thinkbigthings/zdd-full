# ZDD - Front End


## Prerequisites

This project was built with Node 12.14.0


## Intro

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Icons

This project uses [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com) for icons.

## Error Handling

The Error Boundary is for catching general exceptions and errors that the app doesn't know about
such as calling an undefined method at render time. It doesn't catch everything (e.g. inside callbacks)

In general we should favor catching errors at the point we know where an error could occur
such as catching non-200 http responses when fetching data, and displaying an appropriate notification there.


## Upgrade Dependencies

Run `npm update` and `npm audit fix` from the project folder to automatically update dependency versions.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
